# ProjectWork
The program files for my project work, not including project files, results and unused files

How to run the benchmar solution:
1) Run the decentralized solution, this produces an init and init optimal file
2) Copy the init-optimal file to the TSP-solver and run. The solution can be checkd in runtime with the matlab-script.
3) Copy the solution from the TSP-solver together with the init file to the benchmark simulator. Run.
